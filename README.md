# Java Program to Check Whether a Character is Alphabet or Not:
### In this program, , you'll learn to check whether a given character is an alphabet or not. 
### This is done using an if else statement or a ternary operator in Java. 
 
### In Java, char variable stores the ASCII value of a character (number between 0 and 127) rather than the character itself.

### The ASCII value of lowercase alphabets are from 97 to 122. And, the ASCII value of uppercase alphabets are from 65 to 90.

### This is the reason, we compare variable c between 'a' (97) to 'z' (122). Likewise, we do the same to check for uppercase alphabets between 'A' (65) to 'Z' (90).
